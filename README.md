# ReZone
ReZone is a multi-objective optimisation tool for land use allocation in multiple-use environments.
ReZone will generate spatial outputs of landscape functional value and, using Pareto efficiency principles, determine optimal outcomes for land use allocation. 
ReZone also includes an algorithmic tool that can aid in determining the most ideal locations for compensatory habitats. 

This version is for review and testing purposes only.
This version of the software requires the 'raster', 'cpp' and the 'gdistance' (if movement modelling is needed) packages and thier dependencies. 
This version does not include the GUI functionality and the parameters have been set to the same values of the research paper.

This script requires the data in the zipped folder to run. Make sure to unzip the the ReZone Data.zip These files represent the spatial (point and image) data of a section of the model area.

The mining schedule has been randomly generated to simulate multiple land use conflicts. 

Provided the working directory within the script editor has been set appropriately and all data loaded into the workspace, the script will output results based on user decisions.

This review version requires some of the functions to be loaded into the working environments and it is recommended to load all of them.

Descriptions of the code's functionality as well as some necessary instruction have been provided in the script. 

Some functions and commands may take several minutes to complete. The heuristic algorithm may take several hours. 

Thank you for reviewing or testing.
